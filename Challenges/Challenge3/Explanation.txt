The implemented code allows the office to add new printers in the future just extending the printerBuilder class with the classes of the new printers, in this way you can specify the name of the printer and the number of options to print, the printer director will be in charge of the initialization of the printers but just for the implementation of the menu, the dependency that the user has with the printer is injected using a setter method.
